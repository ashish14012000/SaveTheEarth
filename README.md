THE MIGHTY THOR : SAVIOUR OF EARTH

 THOR is renowned as the mightiest hero
 of mythology!Thor's strength, endurance,
 and quest for battle are far greater 
 than his Asgardian brethren. The mighty 
 Thor wields an enchanted Uru hammer,Mjolnir, 
 and is master of thunder and lightning.

 Thor's Powers and Abilities:

 1. Superhuman strength, speed, endurance & 
    resistance to injury.
 2. Member of the otherworldly & virtually 
    immortal Asgardian race.
 3. Wields the enchanted Uru-forged hammer 
    Mjolnir,which grants mastery over the 
    elements of thunder & lightning, as well as 
    the ability to fly & open interdimensional
    gateways.

   Thor is known as the "God of Thunder", and 
   is one of the most powerful of the Asgardians,
   an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, 
   who are therefore considered by some on Earth 
   to be gods.
   
   The Asgardians have advanced science that 
   seems like magic to people of Earth, as shown
   by Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, with which can 
   channel Thor's ability to wield lightning. 
   After Mjölnir is destroyed in the events of 
   Thor:Ragnarok.

   Thor himself helps forge Stormbreaker, an axe 
   channeling the Bifrost, allowing him to 
   effectively travel across the universe at 
   will.
