THE MIGHTY THOR : SAVIOUR OF EARTH

 THOR is renowned as the mightiest hero
 of mythology!Thor's strength, endurance,
 and quest for battle are far greater 
 than his Asgardian brethren. The mighty 
 Thor wields an enchanted Uru hammer,Mjolnir, 
 and is master of thunder and lightning.

 Thor's Powers and Abilities:

 1. Superhuman strength, speed, endurance & 
    resistance to injury.
 2. Member of the otherworldly & virtually 
    immortal Asgardian race.
 3. Wields the enchanted Uru-forged hammer 
    Mjolnir,which grants mastery over the 
	  elements of thunder & lightning, as well as 
	  the ability to fly & open interdimensional
	  gateways.

   Thor is known as the "God of Thunder", and 
   is one of the most powerful of the Asgardians,
   an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, 
   who are therefore considered by some on Earth 
   to be gods.
